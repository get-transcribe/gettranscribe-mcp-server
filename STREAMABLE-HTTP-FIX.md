# Fixed: Streamable HTTP Transport Implementation

## 🔧 What Was Wrong Before

The previous implementation had several issues:
1. **Manual SSE handling** - Trying to manually implement the Streamable HTTP protocol
2. **Incorrect transport usage** - Using `SSEServerTransport` instead of `StreamableHTTPServerTransport`
3. **Protocol mismatch** - Not following the proper Streamable HTTP specification
4. **Session management** - Improper session handling causing repeated connections

## ✅ What Was Fixed

### 1. **Proper SDK Usage**
- Now using `StreamableHTTPServerTransport` from the official MCP SDK
- Following the exact pattern from the TypeScript SDK documentation
- Proper session management with `sessionIdGenerator` and `onsessioninitialized`

### 2. **Correct Transport Handlers**
- Separate handlers for POST (messages), GET (SSE streams), DELETE (termination)
- Proper session ID tracking and cleanup
- Using `transport.handleRequest()` for all request handling

### 3. **Server Instance Management**
- Creating fresh server instances for each session
- Proper tool handler setup in `createServerInstance()`
- Maintaining both stdio and HTTP transport compatibility

### 4. **Session Lifecycle**
- Proper session creation on `initialize` requests
- Session storage and retrieval
- Automatic cleanup on transport close

## 🧪 Testing the Fix

**Stop the current server** (Ctrl+C) and restart:
```bash
./start-http.sh
```

**Expected behavior:**
- ✅ Clean startup without repeated GET requests
- ✅ MCP Inspector should connect successfully
- ✅ Proper session management with unique session IDs
- ✅ All tools should be visible and callable

**Test with MCP Inspector:**
```bash
npx @modelcontextprotocol/inspector http://localhost:8080/mcp
```

## 📊 Key Improvements

1. **No more connection loops** - Proper SSE stream handling
2. **Session persistence** - Clients can maintain state across requests
3. **Better error handling** - Proper HTTP status codes and error responses
4. **SDK compliance** - Following official MCP TypeScript SDK patterns
5. **ChatGPT compatibility** - All required tools (`search`, `fetch`) working correctly

## 🔍 Debug Information

The logs should now show:
- `📨 [POST] Received MCP request` for incoming messages
- `🆕 [POST] New initialization request` for new sessions
- `💾 [POST] Session stored: {sessionId}` when sessions are created
- `🔄 [POST] Reusing session: {sessionId}` for existing sessions
- `🔗 [GET] SSE request - Session: {sessionId}` for SSE connections

## 📖 Reference

This implementation follows the official MCP documentation:
- [Streamable HTTP Transport Specification](./docs-model-context-protocol/transports.md)
- [TypeScript SDK Examples](./docs-model-context-protocol/typescript-sdk.md)

The server now properly implements the Streamable HTTP protocol as intended by the MCP specification! 🎉
